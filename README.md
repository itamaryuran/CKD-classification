# CKD-classification

Hello and welcome to my project
This assignment is part of a data mining course i had at the university.
The main goal was to classify weather a given patient will or will not have CKD (chronic kidney disease)
the dasicion, or classification is based on 24 parameters such as age weight blood sugar etc.
Throughout the assignment i used several model to classify and predict. Models such as decision tree, neural networks, regression and many more.
I used python with some libraries like numpy, pandas, tensorflow and sickitlearn.
I Learned a lot throughout this assignment and looking forward using these tools again. 
You are more than welcome to reach out if you have any questions.
